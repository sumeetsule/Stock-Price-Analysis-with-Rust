# Stock Price Analysis with Rust

<p>As part of my 3rd semester course in Data Engineering with Rust during my Master's in Data Science,I developed a comprehensive stock price analysis tool. This project allowed me to dive deep into Rust's capabilities and leverage powerful libraries like Polars for data manipulation and PostgreSQL for database management in addition to Tableau for visualization.</p>
